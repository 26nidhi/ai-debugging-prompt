### Why I worded it this way

I used simple, clear instructions so the AI assistant knows to help but not solve the problem for the student. The prompt says to look for errors and give hints, not answers. It also tells the AI to be supportive, which helps students feel confident and learn.

### How it avoids giving the solution

The prompt specifically says not to give the solution, corrected code, or direct fixesâ€”just hints and suggestions. This keeps the student thinking and learning instead of copying an answer.

### How it encourages helpful, student-friendly feedback

By asking for a friendly and encouraging tone, the AI will sound supportive, not judgmental. This makes students more comfortable and open to learning. Giving hints helps students figure out mistakes on their own.

#### Reasoning Answers

**What tone and style should the AI use when responding?**  
A positive, encouraging, and friendly tone so students feel supported.

**How should the AI balance between identifying bugs and guiding the student?**  
The AI should point out possible mistakes or confusing spots and give hints, but not say exactly how to fix them.

**How would you adapt this prompt for beginner vs. advanced learners?**  
For beginners, the AI should give more detailed, step-by-step hints. For advanced students, the AI can give higher-level suggestions and let them figure out more on their own.
